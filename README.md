# Music_recommendation


## Overview
"Music_recommendation" is a project designed to explore and implement data clustering techniques. The project uses Python to analyze datasets, apply clustering algorithms, and visualize the results.

## Contents
- `Final.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that contains the exploratory data analysis, clustering algorithm implementation, and visualization of the clustering results.
- `main.py`: A Python script that sets up the data processing pipeline, loads the data, applies clustering algorithms, and saves the output.
